		Devices connected to the Internet are called nodes. Nodes that are computers are called
		hosts. Each node or host is identified by at least one unique number called an Internet
		address or an IP address. Most current IP addresses are four bytes long; these are
		referred to as IPv4 addresses. However, a small but growing number of IP addresses are
		16 bytes long; these are called IPv6 addresses. (4 and 6 refer to the version of the
		Internet Protocol, not the number of the bytes in the address.) Both IPv4 and IPv6
		addresses are ordered sequences of bytes, like an array. They aren’t numbers, and they
		aren’t ordered in any predictable or useful sense. An IPv4 address is normally written
		as four unsigned bytes, each ranging from 0 to 255, with the most significant byte first.
		Bytes are separated by periods for the convenience of human eyes. For example, the
		address for `hermes.oit.unc.edu` is `152.2.21.2`. This is called the dotted quad format.
		An IPv6 address is normally written as eight blocks of four hexadecimal digits separated
		by colons. For example, at the time of this writing, the address of `www.ipv6.com.cn` is
		2001:0250:02FF:0210:0250:8BFF:FEDE:67C8. Leading zeros do not need to be written. Thus,
		the address of `www.ipv6.com.cn` can be written as 2001:250:2FF:210:250:8BFF:FEDE:67C8.
		A double colon, at most one of which may appear in any address, indicates multiple zero
		blocks. For example, FEDC:0000:0000:0000:00DC:0000:7076:0010 could be written more
		compactly as FEDC::DC:0:7076:10. In mixed networks of IPv6 and IPv4, the last four bytes
		of the IPv6 address are sometimes written as an IPv4 dotted quad address. For example,
		FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210 could be written as
		FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:118.84.50.16.
