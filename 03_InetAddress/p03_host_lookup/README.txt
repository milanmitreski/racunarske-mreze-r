Task:

Create a lookup program which will take user input and does the following:
 - if user entered an IP adress, queries the given address and prints out the hostname
 - if user entered a hostname, query the host and print out his IP adress
 
 Note: Beware, an IP adress can be in IPv4 but also IPv6 format - your program must support both
