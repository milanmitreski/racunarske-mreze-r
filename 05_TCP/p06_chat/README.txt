Task:
Create a simple chat application. There can be multiple clients connect to a server
and they can chat to each other, just like in a chat room where everyone can see
other users’ messages. There’s no private chat between two users, for simplicity.
After getting connected to the server, a user must provide his or her name to enter
the chat. The server sends a list of currently online users to the new user.
Every user is notified when a new user arrives and when a user has gone. Each
message is prefixed with the username to keep track who sent the message.
Finally, the user says ‘bye’ to quit the chat.
